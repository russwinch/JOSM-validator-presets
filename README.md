A number of JOSM presets designed for humanitarian mapping with HOT, specifically the Missing Maps project - should be helpful for validators too.

Installation instructions
----------------------------
1. Save all downloaded files in a folder somewhere safe - JOSM doesn't import the files, it just links to them
2. Load the HOT_tools.xml preset file into JOSM via the top menu: *Presets>Preset preferences* (+ button in top right of the right hand *active presets* box)
3. Whilst in the preset preferences add an icon path to the folder where the images were saved (+ button in top right of bottom *icon paths* hand box)
4. Press *OK* and restart JOSM
5. Load some data, select an object and see the presets are now available in the top menu: *Presets>HOT Tools*
6. If desired, add buttons to the top toolbar by right clicking on the toolbar: *Configure toolbar*
7. And/or keyboard shortcuts, via *Preferences>Keyboard shortcuts* (search for *HOT*)
